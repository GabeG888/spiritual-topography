# Description
This project addresses how we can remix data to establish a Theology of Place. Does it matter where Theology happens? Does it matter where the Spirit Moves? Can we even see that happening?

To do this, we will try to "see" the spiritual temperature of a city and gain other insights by:
-   Mapping churches
-   Identifying church ‘dead zones’
-   Identifying spiritual ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ spots
-   Superimposing demographic data:
    -   Income levels
    -   Crime levels
    -   Education
    -   Other metadata
